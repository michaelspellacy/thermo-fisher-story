					<p>As the <abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr> at Thermo Fisher Scientific, what I do every day touches the lives of thousands of people around the world. But sometimes, that work hits a lot closer to home. From a very young age, my twins suffered from a debilitating medical condition that was a frustrating mystery. We felt powerless watching our children suffer severe, life-altering effects from an unknown, and at the time unknowable, disease. For 14 years, our family searched for answers, but doctors didn't have access to the right information to make an accurate diagnosis. Then, in an instant, it all changed. The breakthrough was provided by genetic research-the kind of work we do here at Thermo Fisher. Thanks to sequencing technology-and the people who bring that technology to light-the medical riddle that was locked in my children's DNA was finally solved. Just days after the correct diagnosis, my twins were suddenly enjoying the lives that most healthy children do, a dramatic improvement that happened almost overnight. I'm reminded every day that my children are a living example of the impact of our work.</p>

					<p>In my career, I realize more and more that itâ€™s not just about me, not just about my family, not even about our company. This is about millions of other families who are looking for answers. One of the things we do at Thermo Fisher is to help doctors better understand diseases, giving families around the world answers to the most important questions of all.</p>
